<ramiel> loading kernel EFI stub ... DONE

- nvram persistence ?
 is it possible to do persistence through NVRAM, for example store a .efi in a variable and use that .efi as a stub to load whatever malicious thing you want from the internet

 it would both survive reboots, hard disk wipes and all sorts of other stuff
 right ??
 and since nvram is like 64k theres plenty of space

use boot order and recovery boot order network boot for persistence (pxe boot is pre uefi)
StartImage from ram

in order to survive os reinstall - overwrite uefi shell and set boot order to boot uefi shell
in order to survive hard disk wipe - use PXE boot to load stub from internet

dmpstore then create ramdisk

TODO:
- x86 helloworld
- chainloader (load linux kernel)
- write to uefi vars from usermode via runtime services
- for infection, over-write current bootloader or uefi shell to survive os reinstall (will not survive hard drive nuke)
- hijack boot order or whatever to boot from pxe netboot for recovery
- write read .efi file from uefi and store in var
- load from var
- ransomware from uefi to bypass AV
